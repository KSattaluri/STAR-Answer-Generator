[CONVERSATIONAL_ANSWER]
Sure, a really challenging but ultimately rewarding project comes to mind from my time as a Technical Delivery Manager at a major financial institution. We were launching a critical program to implement a new third-party AML SaaS platform, primarily driven by an upcoming, non-negotiable regulatory deadline. The integration was quite complex, needing to connect with both our mainframe core banking system and a modern customer data hub running Java microservices on AWS EKS. These systems were managed by two separate Agile Release Trains within our SAFe setup.

Right from PI Planning, we identified significant cross-ART dependencies, particularly around API contracts and Kafka event definitions for real-time data sync. My core responsibility was overseeing the end-to-end technical delivery across these two ARTs and the vendor. This involved not just connecting the dots between our internal microservices, mainframe interfaces, the data hub, and the vendor's APIs and Kafka streams, but also actively managing those tricky dependencies that kept evolving.

A big part of my role was aligning key stakeholders who often had competing priorities – the two ART Product Managers focused on their backlogs, the vendor wanting their standard approach, our Enterprise Architect upholding internal standards (especially around data privacy and our Kafka-based event strategy), and the Head of Financial Crime Compliance, whose main concern was hitting that regulatory date. There was also a significant technical disagreement about integration patterns – the vendor preferred pushing data, while our architecture favoured internal pull via Kafka for better control.

So, the first thing I did was establish a dedicated cross-ART technical working group with leads from both ARTs, the vendor, and our architect. We met twice weekly, using a shared Jira Align board to track dependencies tied back to our PI objectives. This was crucial for resolving technical issues like Kafka schema mismatches quickly. For blockers we couldn't solve there, like AWS environment delays impacting testing, I escalated them through our regular ART Sync meetings.

To align stakeholders, I used a mix of approaches. I worked directly with the PMs to negotiate the priority of essential integration stories. A critical point was the push vs. pull debate. I organized focused workshops, listened carefully to the vendor's perspective and our architect's concerns around security and standards. Then, *I personally proposed a hybrid solution*: use the vendor's push API for initial data seeding but implement an internal Kafka-based pull mechanism via a new microservice for ongoing updates. This satisfied our standards, and I successfully negotiated this slight adaptation with the vendor by emphasizing the security benefits. I kept our Compliance Head informed with tailored weekly reports and bi-weekly demos focusing clearly on progress, risks, and mitigation plans.

When integration testing revealed delays that put the deadline at serious risk, *I made the decisive call to proactively model different phased rollout scenarios*. I detailed the functionality and risks for each phase and strongly advocated for a Phase 1 focused *only* on the critical data flows needed for immediate regulatory compliance, using our new Kafka integration. After some intense negotiations where I focused on risk mitigation and compliance adherence, *I successfully drove consensus among all stakeholders for this phased approach*. My own technical understanding of microservices, Kafka, and AWS EKS was vital here, allowing me to ensure the proposed solutions were technically sound and secure.

Ultimately, this strategy paid off. We successfully implemented the hybrid integration pattern, and, most importantly, *delivered Phase 1 right before the regulatory deadline*, meeting our compliance obligations and avoiding significant penalties. The intense collaboration I fostered early on also resulted in 30% fewer integration defects in UAT than projected. We strengthened the vendor relationship and received really positive feedback from Compliance and Architecture for the transparent communication and effective risk management. Phase 2 was then delivered successfully in the following PI.

Looking back, that experience really drove home the importance of proactive dependency management and finding pragmatic, technically sound compromises under pressure. It definitely reinforced for me how critical clear, tailored communication is when navigating complex stakeholder landscapes to achieve a critical business outcome. Since then, I always make it a point to proactively explore and model potential phased delivery options early for any project facing significant deadline pressure or integration complexity.
