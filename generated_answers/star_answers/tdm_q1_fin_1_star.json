    "full_answer": "# Situation\n\nIn my role as a Technical Delivery Manager at a major financial institution, we initiated a critical program to enhance our Financial Crime Compliance capabilities by integrating a new, third-party Anti-Money Laundering (AML) SaaS platform. This was driven by an upcoming, non-negotiable regulatory deadline. The integration scope was complex, requiring connectivity with several core internal systems, including our mainframe Core Banking platform (requiring specific middleware adapters) and our modern Customer Data Hub (built on Java microservices running on AWS EKS). These systems were managed by two separate Agile Release Trains (ARTs) operating within our Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) environment. During Program Increment (PI) Planning, we identified significant cross-ART dependencies, particularly around API contracts and Kafka event stream definitions for real-time data synchronization between the internal systems and the vendor's platform. The vendor provided standard RESTful APIs, but their preferred integration pattern was a direct push from their platform, which conflicted with our internal architectural standards favouring internal pull mechanisms via Kafka for better control and resilience. Furthermore, stringent data privacy requirements necessitated specific data masking and tokenization logic within the integration flows.\n\n# Task\n\nMy primary responsibility as the TDM was to oversee the end-to-end technical delivery of this integration across the two ARTs and the vendor. This involved ensuring seamless integration between our internal Java microservices, the Core Banking interfaces, the Customer Data Hub, and the vendor's SaaS platform via REST APIs and Kafka streams. Crucially, I needed to:\n1.  Actively manage the complex cross-ART dependencies that became increasingly challenging post-PI Planning due to evolving requirements and technical roadblocks.\n2.  Facilitate alignment and resolve conflicts between the Product Managers of the two ARTs (who had competing priorities for their teams' capacity), the Vendor's Implementation Manager (focused on adhering to their standard deployment model), our Enterprise Architect (enforcing internal standards and data privacy protocols), and the Head of Financial Crime Compliance (our key business stakeholder, primarily concerned with meeting the regulatory deadline and functional completeness).\n3.  Navigate the technical disagreements regarding integration patterns (push vs. pull) and ensure the chosen solution was robust, compliant, and maintainable.\n4.  Mitigate the significant risk of missing the regulatory deadline by negotiating a technically feasible and stakeholder-accepted delivery plan, potentially involving a phased rollout.\n\n# Action\n\n1.  **Dependency & Integration Management:** I immediately established a cross-ART technical working group, including lead engineers from both ARTs, the vendor's technical lead, and the Enterprise Architect. We met twice weekly, using a shared dependency tracking board (visualized via Jira Align) linked back to the PI objectives. When Kafka schema mismatches and API contract ambiguities arose post-PI Planning, I facilitated deep-dive sessions to resolve them, ensuring versioning control and clear documentation. I used the ART Sync meetings to provide visibility on integration progress and escalate technical impediments that the working group couldn't resolve, such as delays in environment provisioning on AWS EKS needed for end-to-end testing.\n2.  **Stakeholder Alignment & Negotiation:** I initiated separate and joint discussions with the stakeholders.\n    *   **Product Managers:** I worked with the PMs to understand their ART backlogs and capacity constraints, negotiating the prioritization of essential integration user stories required for the AML solution, linking them directly to the regulatory compliance objective.\n    *   **Vendor & Architect:** I organized focused workshops to address the push vs. pull debate. I actively listened to the vendor's rationale (simplicity for them) and the Architect's concerns (security, control, data privacy, alignment with our event-driven architecture strategy using Kafka). I presented a hybrid solution proposal: using the vendor's push API for initial data seeding but implementing an internal Kafka-based pull mechanism (via a bespoke integration microservice) for ongoing real-time updates, satisfying our architectural standards and data control needs. This required negotiation with the vendor to slightly adapt their standard approach, which I achieved by highlighting the security benefits and our commitment to managing the transformation layer.\n    *   **Compliance Head:** I maintained transparent communication through weekly status reports and bi-weekly demos, clearly outlining progress, risks (especially regarding the deadline), and the proposed mitigation strategies.\n3.  **Conflict Resolution & Phased Rollout:** The hybrid integration pattern required extra effort. Coupled with delays discovered during integration testing, it became clear the full scope wouldn't meet the initial deadline. I modelled different phased rollout scenarios, detailing the functionality included in each phase, the associated risks, and the timeline. Phase 1 focused on integrating critical customer onboarding data flows via the new Kafka-based mechanism to meet the immediate regulatory requirement. Phase 2 included less critical batch updates using a modified vendor API approach. I presented these options to all key stakeholders, including the Head of Compliance, emphasizing how Phase 1 met the core regulatory need. After intense negotiation, focusing on risk mitigation and compliance adherence, we gained consensus on the phased approach.\n4.  **Technical Oversight:** Leveraging my understanding of microservices, APIs, Kafka, and AWS, I could actively participate in technical discussions, challenge assumptions, and ensure the proposed solutions were viable and aligned with both functional and non-functional requirements, particularly around performance and security within the EKS environment.\n\n# Result\n\nThrough proactive dependency management, strategic negotiation, and fostering cross-functional alignment, we achieved the following:\n*   Successfully negotiated and implemented the hybrid integration pattern, satisfying both vendor requirements and internal architectural/security standards.\n*   Gained unanimous stakeholder agreement on a phased rollout plan, critically ensuring Phase 1 delivery before the regulatory deadline.\n*   Delivered the core AML integration functionality (Phase 1) on time, enabling the bank to meet its regulatory compliance obligations and avoid significant penalties.\n*   Effectively managed cross-ART dependencies, minimizing disruption to other planned PI objectives within the involved ARTs. Integration defects found in UAT were 30% lower than initially projected due to the rigorous cross-team collaboration established early on.\n*   Strengthened the relationship with the vendor by finding a mutually acceptable technical compromise.\n*   Received positive feedback from the Head of Financial Crime Compliance and the Enterprise Architect for transparent communication, effective risk management, and successfully navigating complex technical and stakeholder challenges to meet the critical business outcome. Phase 2 was subsequently delivered successfully in the following PI."
