# Situation

In my role as a Technical Delivery Manager at a major investment bank, we faced an urgent mandate to enhance our MiFID II transaction reporting capabilities. A regulatory update required us to include several new data attributes related to trade execution specifics, sourced from disparate systems, within a non-negotiable six-month deadline. Failure to comply carried the risk of significant daily fines and severe reputational damage. The delivery required orchestrating work across three distinct Agile Release Trains (ARTs) operating within our SAFe framework: the primary "Regulatory Reporting ART" (owning the reporting engine), the "Core Trading Systems ART" (owning the legacy trade capture systems and associated SOAP APIs), and the "Data Platform ART" (managing the Oracle Data Warehouse). The technical solution involved enhancing our Java/Spring Boot microservices-based reporting engine, integrating with legacy Core Banking SOAP APIs, sourcing enriched data via Kafka streams populated from the Data Warehouse, and deploying the updated services via established CI/CD pipelines to our AWS environment. The complexity was amplified by conflicting priorities across ARTs, intricate technical dependencies between new microservices and legacy systems, and the need for rigorous validation involving the Head of Regulatory Reporting, the Compliance Officer, and external auditors.

# Task

My primary responsibility was to lead the end-to-end technical delivery of this critical MiFID II enhancement, ensuring successful implementation before the regulatory deadline. This involved:
1.  Securing commitment and aligning priorities across the three involved ARTs during PI Planning.
2.  Managing complex cross-ART dependencies and technical integration challenges, particularly between the modern microservices architecture and the legacy SOAP APIs.
3.  Facilitating effective communication and collaboration between technology teams (developers, testers, architects, DevOps), business stakeholders (Head of Regulatory Reporting, Product Managers), Compliance, and potentially external consultants reviewing the solution.
4.  Proactively identifying and mitigating risks related to timelines, data quality, system integration, and performance.
5.  Negotiating scope adjustments and resource allocation where necessary, balancing the regulatory imperative against other ongoing business initiatives within the ARTs.
6.  Ensuring the final solution was robust, compliant, performant, and delivered via our standard CI/CD processes.

# Action

To ensure successful delivery under pressure, I took the following actions:
*   **Cross-ART Alignment & PI Planning:** Ahead of the upcoming Program Increment (PI) Planning event, I proactively engaged with the RTEs and Product Managers from the Core Trading and Data Platform ARTs. I presented the regulatory mandate's criticality, outlining the specific capabilities needed from their teams and the severe consequences of non-compliance. During PI Planning, I facilitated detailed dependency mapping sessions using our digital program board (e.g., Jira Align), clearly visualizing the required features from each ART and their interdependencies. We explicitly defined PI Objectives related to this regulatory initiative for all three ARTs, ensuring shared understanding and commitment.
*   **Stakeholder Management & Communication:** I established a robust communication cadence: weekly sync-ups with the Scrum Masters and technical leads from each contributing team, bi-weekly cross-ART dependency checks involving RTEs, and a bi-weekly Steering Committee meeting with the Head of Regulatory Reporting, Compliance Officer, Enterprise Architects, and key Product Managers. I provided transparent status reporting, highlighting risks (e.g., potential delays in API delivery from Core Trading) and proposed mitigation strategies.
*   **Dependency & Integration Management:** I coordinated closely with the architects to define clear API contracts (Swagger/OpenAPI for RESTful interactions between microservices, WSDL for SOAP) and data schemas (for Kafka topics). We set up dedicated integration environments and prioritized integration testing early in the development cycle. For the legacy SOAP API integration, we assigned dedicated engineers from both ARTs to collaborate, using stubbed services initially to de-couple development streams before performing end-to-end testing. We ensured the Data Platform ART delivered the required data feeds to Kafka on schedule, working with them to resolve data quality issues identified during testing.
*   **Strategic Negotiation & Conflict Resolution:** A major conflict arose when the Core Trading Systems ART indicated a potential 3-sprint delay in delivering their SOAP API enhancements due to resource contention with a critical platform stability initiative. Recognizing the immovable regulatory deadline, I convened an urgent meeting with the Core Trading RTE, their Product Manager, the Head of Regulatory Reporting, and our Lead Architect. I framed the discussion around the quantifiable financial risk of non-compliance versus the impact of re-prioritizing specific features within their stability initiative. Through negotiation, we agreed on a phased delivery for the API: Core Trading would deliver the absolute essential data fields within 4 sprints (meeting our critical path), with less critical enhancements deferred to a subsequent release. This required adjusting the initial scope slightly for day 1, which I cleared with Compliance and the Business, ensuring the core regulatory requirement was still met.
*   **Risk Mitigation & Quality Assurance:** We proactively identified risks like data lineage validation and potential performance bottlenecks in the reporting microservice under peak load. We implemented enhanced data validation checks within the Kafka processing pipeline and conducted rigorous performance testing in a production-like AWS environment, tuning the Spring Boot services and database queries accordingly. I ensured Compliance was involved throughout, reviewing requirements, data mappings, and test results.

# Result

Despite the complexities and conflicting priorities, the MiFID II reporting enhancement was successfully delivered and deployed to production one week ahead of the regulatory deadline.
*   The solution passed all internal testing cycles, rigorous UAT conducted by the Regulatory Reporting team, and received sign-off from the Compliance Officer and external auditors.
*   The bank avoided significant regulatory fines and potential reputational damage.
*   The Head of Regulatory Reporting commended the team for the timely and accurate delivery under pressure.
*   The successful integration between the new Java/Spring Boot microservices and the legacy Core Banking SOAP APIs provided a pattern for future modernization efforts.
*   Crucially, the process fostered stronger cross-ART collaboration and dependency management practices, particularly highlighted during the PI Planning retrospective as a positive outcome driven by the necessity of meeting the regulatory goal. We established clearer processes for negotiating priorities and managing dependencies for future cross-ART initiatives.
