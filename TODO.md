# STAR Answer Generator TODO List

## Testing Scenarios

### Basic Functionality Testing
- [X] Test single role, multiple prompts, multiple questions configuration
- [ ] Test multiple roles, multiple questions, multiple prompts configuration
- [ ] Verify resume functionality works correctly with the new naming scheme
- [ ] Validate that industry contextualization works properly across different roles

### Prompt Content Validation
- [X] Implement logging of full prompts after parameter injection for each stage
- [ ] Add option to save complete prompts to files for manual review
- [ ] Review sub-prompt content coherence for each role/industry combination
- [ ] Ensure STAR answer generator receives appropriate context from sub-prompts
- [ ] Validate conversational transformer correctly references STAR answer content

### Cross-Stage Coherence
- [ ] Verify role-specific skills are correctly loaded and applied in all stages
