# STAR Answer Generation System - Implementation Plan

This document outlines the step-by-step implementation process for building the STAR Answer Generation System according to the project requirements.

## Phase 1: Project Setup and Core Infrastructure

### Step 1: Environment and Configuration Setup
- [ ] Create a `.env` file for API keys (GEMINI_API_KEY, ANTHROPIC_API_KEY)
- [ ] Create a comprehensive `config.yaml` with all necessary parameters:
  - LLM settings (models, temperature, max tokens)
  - File paths for prompts and outputs
  - Processing parameters (retries, timeouts)
  - Target roles, industries, and questions
- [ ] Set up a virtual environment with all dependencies
- [ ] Implement a configuration loader module

### Step 2: Logging and State Management
- [ ] Create a logging module with configurable levels and file output
- [ ] Design and implement a SQLite-based state management system:
  - Create schema for tracking file processing status
  - Implement functions for adding, updating, and querying file status
  - Add support for tracking retry attempts and error messages

### Step 3: LLM Client Implementation
- [ ] Create a unified LLM client class that supports both Gemini and Claude
- [ ] Implement provider fallback mechanism
- [ ] Add exponential backoff retry logic
- [ ] Implement proper error handling and reporting

## Phase 2: Sub-Prompt Generation (Stage 1)

### Step 4: Meta-Prompt Processing
- [ ] Create a module to load and process the meta_prompt.md template
- [ ] Implement parameter substitution for role, industry, and question
- [ ] Design a function to generate sub-prompts using the primary LLM
- [ ] Add validation for generated sub-prompts (JSON structure, required fields)

### Step 5: Sub-Prompt Storage and Resilience
- [ ] Implement functions to save sub-prompts to disk in JSON format
- [ ] Create a module to load previously generated sub-prompts
- [ ] Add state tracking for sub-prompt generation
- [ ] Implement resumption logic for interrupted processing

## Phase 3: STAR Answer Generation (Stage 2)

### Step 6: Main Context Integration
- [ ] Create a module to load and process the main_context_prompt.md template
- [ ] Implement parameter substitution for role, industry, and other variables
- [ ] Design a function to combine main context with sub-prompts

### Step 7: STAR Answer Generation
- [ ] Implement the core STAR answer generation function
- [ ] Add validation for generated answers (structure, completeness)
- [ ] Create a structured directory hierarchy for saving answers
- [ ] Implement state tracking and resumption for answer generation

### Step 8: Output Organization
- [ ] Create a consistent file naming convention
- [ ] Implement directory structure creation based on role/question/industry
- [ ] Add metadata to generated files (timestamp, parameters used)

## Phase 4: Conversational Transformation (Stage 3)

### Step 9: Answer Scanning and Processing
- [ ] Implement a module to scan and locate all generated STAR answers
- [ ] Create a queue system for processing answers
- [ ] Design a function to read and prepare STAR answers for transformation

### Step 10: Conversational Styling
- [ ] Create a module to load and process the conversation_prompt_fixed.txt template
- [ ] Implement the transformation function using the LLM client
- [ ] Add validation for conversational answers
- [ ] Extract and format metadata from the responses

### Step 11: Output Storage and State Tracking
- [ ] Implement functions to save conversational answers alongside originals
- [ ] Update state tracking for the transformation process
- [ ] Add resumption logic for interrupted conversational transformations

## Phase 5: System Integration and Testing

### Step 12: Main Application Flow
- [ ] Create the main application entry point
- [ ] Implement command-line argument parsing
- [ ] Design the overall process flow with proper sequencing
- [ ] Add graceful shutdown handling

### Step 13: Comprehensive Testing
- [ ] Create unit tests for each module
- [ ] Implement integration tests for the full pipeline
- [ ] Add specific tests for resilience features (interruption, resumption)
- [ ] Test with various roles, industries, and questions

### Step 14: Performance Optimization
- [ ] Identify and optimize bottlenecks
- [ ] Implement parallel processing where appropriate
- [ ] Add caching mechanisms for expensive operations
- [ ] Optimize database queries and file operations

## Phase 6: Documentation and Deployment

### Step 15: Documentation
- [ ] Create comprehensive README.md
- [ ] Document all configuration options
- [ ] Add usage examples and sample outputs
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guide

### Step 16: Final Deployment Preparation
- [ ] Create installation and setup scripts
- [ ] Implement a clean startup/shutdown process
- [ ] Add system health monitoring
- [ ] Create backup and recovery procedures
